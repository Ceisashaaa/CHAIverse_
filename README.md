# LLM Entertainment Prompt Engineering Portfolio  
*by Ceisa Shaquila – General Application @ CHAI*

Welcome to my playground of prompt engineering experiments using ChatGPT and CHAI. This project reflects my self-driven exploration of language model behavior—how it thinks, reacts, entertains, and retains users. It’s a mix of science, creativity, and human psychology.

I’m applying to CHAI because you build AI with *personality*. And so do I.

## Why Me, Why CHAI?
- I don’t just prompt—I *engineer experiences*  
- I experiment fast, write faster, and learn in loops  
- I’m obsessed with how humans talk to machines—and how to make it feel real

I want to bring my blend of STEM discipline, AI curiosity, and storytelling instinct to CHAI’s world-class team. Whether it’s product testing, creative writing, or UX-style LLM tuning—I’m *in*.
